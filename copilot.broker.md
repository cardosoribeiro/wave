# jPOS Broker Design

## Components

### POS Connector
- Listens for incoming messages from POS systems.
- Parses ISO-8583 messages.
- Validates message format and content.

### Acquirer Connector
- Manages communication with the acquirer bank.
- Formats messages according to the acquirer's specifications.
- Handles response messages from the acquirer.

### Message Processor
- Routes messages between POS and acquirer connectors.
- Translates message formats if necessary.
- Applies business logic for transaction processing.

### Transaction Manager
- Manages transaction states (e.g., pending, authorized, settled).
- Handles different transaction types (e.g., authorization, settlement, reversal).
- Ensures transactional integrity and consistency.

### Logging and Monitoring
- Logs all incoming and outgoing messages.
- Monitors transaction flow and system health.
- Provides alerts for errors and anomalies.

### Configuration Manager
- Manages configuration settings (e.g., connection details, timeouts).
- Supports dynamic reconfiguration without restarting the broker.

## Message Flow

1. **POS to Broker**
   - The POS sends a transaction request to the broker.
   - The POS Connector parses and validates the message.
   - The Message Processor processes the request.

2. **Broker to Acquirer**
   - The Message Processor forwards the request to the Acquirer Connector.
   - The Acquirer Connector formats and sends the request to the acquirer bank.

3. **Acquirer Response**
   - The acquirer bank sends a response back to the Acquirer Connector.
   - The Acquirer Connector parses the response.

4. **Broker to POS**
   - The Message Processor processes the response.
   - The POS Connector formats and sends the response back to the POS.

## Example Workflow

1. **Authorization Request**
   - POS sends authorization request to Broker.
   - Broker processes the request and forwards it to the Acquirer.
   - Acquirer responds with authorization result.
   - Broker processes the response and sends it back to the POS.

2. **Settlement Request**
   - POS sends settlement request to Broker.
   - Broker processes the request and forwards it to the Acquirer.
   - Acquirer responds with settlement result.
   - Broker processes the response and sends it back to the POS.

## Configuration

- Configuration settings are managed by the Configuration Manager.
- Settings include connection details, timeouts, retry policies, etc.
- Configuration changes can be applied dynamically without restarting the broker.
