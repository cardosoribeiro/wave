# Fintech ecosystem

The fintechs may promote competition, enhance the SFN’s efficiency and, ultimately, favor the financial inclusion, given the potential increase in the availability of alternative products and sources of financing. In Brazil, the ecosystem of fintechs is diversified, and they operate in several market segments: credit, payments, financial management, loans, investments, private financing, insurance, debt negotiation and crypt assets and ledgers (Distributed Ledger – DLTs).   

Some of fintechs’ segments are already included within the regulatory scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil (CVM) and Superintendency of Private Insurance (Susep). Other segments are included in the regulatory scope of the Banco Central do Brasil’s (BCB)  – such as the credit and payments segments.   

The BCB's monitors technological innovations — aligned to those of other regulatory bodies and with the governmental agenda — and assess their potential impacts on operations conducted within the National Financial System (SFN) and the Brazilian Payment System (SPB).  

## Credit fintechs 

Given their low-cost operational structure, the credit fintechs are specialized in providing financial services to economic segments with a short credit record in Brazil — such as Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The BCB licenses two types of credit fintechs  

Direct Credit Society (SCD) – ‘Sociedades de Crédito Direto’; 
Peer-to-Peer Loan Company (SEP) ‘Sociedade de empréstimo entre pessoas’.
SCD: financial institutions that carry out — exclusively through electronic platforms — operations of loan, financing and acquisition of credit rights. The SCD may operating with its own capital The SCD shall not raise funds from the public—except upon issuance of shares—and participate in the capital of financial institutions.   

Since March 2020, the SCD are able to fund their operations with resources from the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) — becoming thus another important channel for carrying out public policies, given their capillarity.  

SEP: are financial institutions that perform — exclusively through an electronic platform — peer-to-peer loan and financing operations. In such credit operations, the funds collected from creditors are directed to debtors after negotiation. The SEP can neither carry out loan and financing operations with its own funds nor hold shares of financial institutions. Accordingly, the SEP must use a credit analysis model capable of providing potential creditors with indicators that impartially reflect the risks of potential debtors and the credit operations. Other prohibitions, operational limits and additional provisions are available in the norm related to SEP.  

The credit fintechs’ corporate control may be conducted indirectly by “private equity funds”, through a legal person resident in Brazil, whose specific corporate purpose is to hold financial institutions’ shares.  

## Securitization, insurance and other services

The SCD may sell or assign credits related to their operations, exclusively, to:

Financial institutions; 
Several types of funds of investment whose quotas are offered exclusively to qualified investors — defined as such by the CVM’s regulations. 
Securitization companies that distribute the underlying assets exclusively to accredited investors. 
The SCDs and the SEPs may also act as insurance representatives by distributing insurance related to their respective above-mentioned operations, in accordance with the National Council of Private Insurance’s (CNSP) regulation.  

The SCD and the SEP can provide the following services: credit analysis to third parties, collection to third parties, and issuance of electronic money. Issuance of credit cards and other postpaid payment instruments are allowed exclusively to SCD.  

## Foreign capital in credit fintechs

A presidential decree stablished that foreign capital participation of up to 100 percent into credit fintechs is in the best interest of the government, favoring competition and technological innovation in the industry. Accordingly, the SCD and SEP are allowed to attract external capital through a faster track than before, since it is no longer required the issuance of a specific presidential decree approving each foreign investment in fintechs.  

## International coordination

The fintech topics have been regularly discussed on international forums in which BCB participates, including the Financial Stability Board (FSB); the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)—both under the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  

## Legislation

CMN Resolution 4,656/2018 - Provides for the direct credit company and the peer-to-peer loan company, regulates the peer-to-peer loan and financing operations and establishes requirements and procedures for license approval, transfer of corporate control, restructuring and license revocation of the institutions mentioned therein.  

## Lift initiative

In May 2018, BCB launched the Financial and Technological Innovations Lab (Lift)—a virtual environment that allows the collaboration between the academia, the market, technology enterprises and startups—aiming at developing technological innovation, sharing knowledge and evaluating of the projects’ results.  

The Lift is jointly carried out with the National Federation of the BCB's  Civil Servants Associations (Fenasbac), while large tech companies will support ideas selected by the Program. In the Lift’s portal, interested persons and enterprises can submit their projects, which should be aligned with the themes defined by the committee composed by BCB, IT enterprises and Fenasbac.  

## Developed projects

Approved projects will be submitted to an incubation process and receive the support for the development of a prototype. The LIFT 2018 Edition developed 12 projects, while the 2019 Edition develops 17 projects. The Lift is part of the BCB's effort to foster technological innovation in the National Financial System (SFN), generating value for the financial sector and for the entire Brazilian society.  

## LIFT Learning

Since the BCB has been identifing some gaps (potential improvement areas) in financial regulation, it evaluates the potential contributions of new technologies to the SFN's capabilities. In this vein, the program LIFT Learning was launched in November 2019 with the objective of stimulating and accelerating the development of selected projects that bringing together university colleges and entities with needs not met by the original LIFT Program's scope. Specifically, Lift Learning focuses on projects to be developed by undergraduate and graduate-level students.
